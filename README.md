Chaos! HTTP
============

Chaos HTTP is a super simple Node app that stands up an HTTP server to return error conditions. It is similar
in concept to [httpbin](http://httpbin.org) but far less functional :).

It does not have any external dependencies outside the core NodeJS libraries so it does have that going for it ...
